        <p>i think i miss you a lot i want to yap about silly stuffs to you i want to express my darkest thoughts to you you’re the only one i wanna confide to i wanna talk about how i cry thinking about you i wanna tell you how broken my heart is i wanna tell you that i miss having a sister asf that i really cry on my prayer rug begging god to let me be by your side again even tho the thing i need is most you being by my side but i can’t say that to you cause i said i won’t bother you again but the majority of my problems will be solved if you just say to me that you were really disappointed in me but that you know how sincere i am about my feelings towards you and that you’ll give me another chance and that well street everything over again and that ill told you that you hurted me a lot when you made me understand that some people are more important than me for you and i was jealous cause there’re not people who are more important than you for me so that’s the main reason why i said i couldn’t have you as a simple friend that’s cause i was disappointed that you could ever think ig me that way so i said those to hurt you cause you hurted me but that wasn’t mature of me i should’ve just tell you what was on my mind. and low that everything is over i just hope that you’ll forgive me someday and will want me in your life again but i feel like it’s never going to happen and that’s why i always cry at nights. and also even if this day happen i’m scared that we will never be friends like we used to and the only way of us being like before is having a long long long conversation where we talk about everything and forgive eo for everything and that we start talking again about our lives and doing confidences to eo that we will never tell to anyone else cause we have the same personality and we value people the same way. i wish you could tap again about how you live your plushies like you used to do when we started to become friends and how you live your minmin panda plushie. i want to yap about how i cuddle my stitch plushie hard when i’m sad about you cause a few days before my final exams you referred yourself as this stitch plushie and i really like her a lot and it makes it feel like there’s a presence of you. i miss you so much and i want to back. i wanna talk about your comfort movies or songs or books and watch them or listen or read them cause i wanna do everything that you love cause i love you 
i want to have you by my side when i enter college and yap about the new friends ill made but always reassure you by saying that they’ll never be more important than you
that’s just how much i love you ash, writing that at 3am cause you’re everything i’m thinking of</p>
